Extract the grade of this exam. It is a number between 0 and 10, which is written with a red pen on the bottom-right corner of the image. Even if you see multiple numbers in the image, take the biggest one as the final grade, which, again, at the bottom right corner. Don't confuse zeros with sixes, 
zeros are normally crossed. Sometimes you'll find the grade number sorrounded by a circle, or underlined. The field of your JSON output will have the name "grade".
