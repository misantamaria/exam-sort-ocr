Extract the grade of this exam, which is normally written with a red pen on the bottom-right corner of the image. Even if you see multiple numbers in the image, take the biggest one as the final grade, which, again, is normally at the bottom right corner. Don't confuse zeros with sixes, only say 6 when it's clear, sometimes I draw zeros that look like sixes. Sometimes you'll find the grade number sorrounded by a circle, or underlined, don't confuse that with a number. The field of your JSON output will have the name "grade".
